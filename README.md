# **Pizza-Sales Data Analysis and Visualization Project**

### **Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw sales data collection to interactive visualization. The goal was to gather key insights into sales trends, product performance, and customer preferences by using **SQL Server** for data transformation and **Power BI** for dashboard creation.

### **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Downloaded sales data CSV file from Kaggle.
   
2. **Data Import and Transformation**  
   - Imported the CSV file into **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**.  
   - Wrote optimized SQL queries to clean, transform, and extract meaningful insights, such as:
     - Total revenue generated.
     - Average order value.
     - Top-selling pizza categories.
     - Daily order trends.

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Connected Power BI to SQL Server.  
   - Designed an **interactive, multi-view dashboard** to visualize key metrics and trends.  
   - The dashboard includes views for:
     - **Revenue trends over time**  
     - **Top-selling products**  
     - **Daily and monthly order analysis**
